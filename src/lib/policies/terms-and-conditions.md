## **CHOICE OF LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

In case of a dispute between you and Next Wave Ad, please get in touch with Next Wave Ad customer service for resolution. Any disagreement or claim arising from your use of the website, the information provided on it, or any other communication from Next Wave Ad, as well as any dispute regarding the services offered by Next Wave Ad, must be settled under the laws of the jurisdiction where Next Wave Ad is registered.

Should a dispute arise, both parties agree to resolve it in the courts located in the jurisdiction of Next Wave Ad. Both parties agree that the court will have the authority to award equitable relief and direct, actual damages, but not punitive damages, consequential damages, lost profits, or special, indirect, incidental, or compensatory damages.

However, the court may award liquidated damages, legal fees, and costs to Next Wave Ad if a user acts fraudulently or willfully. Additionally, if a customer requests a chargeback without sufficient justification, as determined by Next Wave Ad at its sole discretion, or after Next Wave Ad has paid any third party related to the chargeback, the court may grant any remedy provided in these Terms in favour of Next Wave Ad.

Each party will be responsible for their costs and any counsel fees they incur unless stated otherwise in these Terms. The jurisdiction laws where Next Wave Ad is registered govern these Terms and any related disputes. Any dispute between the parties, including those related to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, the Services, or their performance, must be settled in a court within the jurisdiction specified.

You agree that if you file a lawsuit in connection with these Terms outside of the specified jurisdiction, you will indemnify Next Wave Ad and be liable to Next Wave Ad for all expenses, including legal fees, incurred by the company.

## **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**Severability:** If any provision of these Terms is deemed illegal, void, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be modified to make it enforceable while preserving the parties' original intent to the maximum extent permitted by law. If the modified provision is still found invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable, it will not affect the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.

**Entire Agreement:** These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Next Wave Ad regarding the Services, replacing all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral. You acknowledge that you have had the opportunity to review these Terms and our Privacy Policy with counsel of your choice.

No Informal Waivers, Agreements, or Representations: Failure by either party to act regarding a breach of these Terms does not waive the right to act regarding that breach or subsequent breaches. Except as expressly provided in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by either party or its affiliates will be legally binding unless documented in writing, expressly referring to these Terms, and stating the intent to modify or supplement them.

**Assignment and Delegation:** You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written permission from Next Wave Ad. Any attempted assignment or delegation by you without such consent will be ineffective. Next Wave Ad may freely assign or delegate some or all of its rights and obligations under these Terms and the Privacy Policy, effective upon notice sent to you at the email address we have on file, or if we have no email address for you, by posting a notice of assignment on the Website.
