title: "Refund Policy"
---

At **Next Wave Ad**, we strive to provide exceptional marketing services and value your business. While our policy generally does not offer refunds, we understand that there are specific circumstances where a refund may be appropriate. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which we may issue a refund and the procedure for requesting one.

## **GENERAL REFUND POLICY**

On average, **Next Wave Ad** does not provide refunds, as you are responsible for ordering our services. Once you place an order, our team begins working on your project immediately, including analysing your brand, online presence, competitors, and marketing gaps. Therefore, refunds are generally not available except in the cases outlined below.

## **REFUND CONDITIONS**

Refunds may be considered under the following circumstances:

- **Technical Bugs Leading to Overpayment:** If a technical issue results in an overpayment for our services, we will issue a refund for the excess amount.
- **Overpayment Due to Your Mistake:** We will refund the extra amount paid if you accidentally overpay for our services. Please note that refunds are only applicable to the overpaid portion.
- **Refunds Before Payment to Third Parties:** Refunds are possible if requested before we have paid any third parties or allocated your marketing budget to advertising platforms. Refunds are no longer available once payment has been forwarded to third parties or platforms.

## **REFUND REQUEST PROCEDURE**

To request a refund, please send an email to info@nextwavead.com with the following details:

- **Invoice:** A copy of the invoice related to the payment in question.
- **Payment Confirmation Document:** Proof of payment, such as a bank statement or transaction receipt.
- **Date:** The date of the payment.
- **The sum of Payment:** The amount paid.
- **Payment Method:** The method used for payment (e.g., credit card, bank transfer).
- **Explanation:** A clear explanation of why you are requesting a refund.

Please ensure all requested information is provided to facilitate the review and processing of your refund request.

Upon receiving your refund request, you will receive a confirmation email indicating that we have received it. We will process your refund request within 7 business days and email you a resolution.

- **If your request is eligible**, the amount will be refunded using the same payment method used for the original transaction.
- **If your request is not eligible for a refund**, we will provide a clear explanation detailing why the refund cannot be issued.

We are committed to addressing your concerns promptly and transparently. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

## **NON-REFUNDABLE CASES**

Refunds are not available in the following situations:

- **Change of Mind:** If you change your mind about the services after placing an order, refunds will not be issued. Our team begins work on your project immediately upon receiving your data, even before payment. This includes comprehensive brand analysis and strategic planning.
- However, if you are dissatisfied with the proposed solution, feel that it does not meet your expectations, or find the offered services irrelevant or ineffective, these concerns are matters for negotiation. We pride ourselves on our flexibility and are committed to working collaboratively with you to craft a solution that perfectly aligns with your marketing objectives. Our goal is to ensure that you receive the most effective and relevant strategies to achieve your business goals.
